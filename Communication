Hi!

First of all apologies for pinging you over a PR. It felt like the only way to reach you.
I noticed that github.com/duffel doesn't seem to (at least publicly)  contain much content.
You may not want to give away the name but i wanted to at least ask if you would be willing to part ways with it.
I'd love to be able to use it.

Thank you!
